[Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) Facade for [Dimple.js](http://dimplejs.org/) Library

Scala.js facade for Dimple.js library. Dimple.js is based on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). This facade was written for the version v2.0.0 of dimple.js. This is still in its early stages. Please, do use this and report any issues you may find or encounter. If you need more documentation on how this is used, you should visit the Dimple.js [wiki](https://github.com/PMSI-AlignAlytics/dimple/wiki).

An example application was written to show how this library could be used [here](https://github.com/fasholaide/Dimple.Scalajs.Example). The application show cases how a Bar Chart and a Line Chart can be constructed.

P.S. To use this library now, you could just publish to your local maven directory by runing `sbt publish` and add the following `"org.dimple.scalajs" % "dimple-scalajs_sjs0.6_2.11" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"` to the list of dependencies to your build.sbt file.

Ahoy!
